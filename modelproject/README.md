# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Model Project** and is about using Python to simulate a theoretical Solow model known from courses of macroeconomics. Firstly, the model will be specified including the relevant equations of the dynamics in the Solow model and lastly, it will be simulated and concluded. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** To do the simulation, the optimization and the illustration we use the standard Anaconda 3, matplotlib and scipy.
